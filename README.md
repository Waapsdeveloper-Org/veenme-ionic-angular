# Veenme - Ionic Angular Project (Early 2022 Version)

## Overview

Welcome to Veenme, an Ionic Angular project developed in the early months of 2022. While the backend functionality, which originally focused on creating location-based posts and shoutouts, is no longer available due to API expiration, the project remains a valuable resource for education purposes. The main highlights include component-wise layouts, emphasizing code organization and structure. Additionally, the project integrates Google Maps for enhanced user experience.

## Features

1. **Login and Signup Screens:**
   - Provides a basic authentication system with login and signup screens.
   - Demonstrates user authentication and session management.

2. **Component-Wise Layouts:**
   - Organizes the project using a component-based architecture for better code maintainability.
   - Each feature or UI element is encapsulated within its own component for modularity.

3. **Google Map Integration:**
   - Original implementation included Google Maps integration for location-based features.
   - Code showcases the integration process and usage of Google Maps within an Ionic Angular app.
